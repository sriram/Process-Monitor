Process Monitor

A simple utility to get the process id and it status.

The input required are the process type i.e. ruby,java or so on and a pattern to identify the process.

The pattern here could be any part of the name of the process to allow you to get an exact match of the process. 

For example if you want to get the pid of all Ruby processes do this:

 ProcessMonitor.get_pid("ruby")

will return an array of pids in case of many Ruby processes and return a single pid in case of a single Ruby process.

If you want to get the status of a process

  ProcessMonitor.get_process_status(pid)

will return the state of the process i.e. running/sleeping etc.

if you want to check if a process is up

  ProcessMonitor.process_is_up?(pid)

will return "true" or "false"
